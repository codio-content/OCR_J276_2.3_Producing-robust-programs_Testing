**Iterative** testing means that it is repeated and is part of the system development cycle.
Iterative tests are carried out as the software is being developed. Tests are carried out on each module and the results are used to inform further development.
For example if the first part of a program is to authenticate a user, then this part can be tested to ensure that it functions as required and there are no errors. It can also be used to test for ease of use and the suitability of the user interface.

**Final or terminal testing** is carried out when the software is ready for release and is usually carried out by a selected group of end-users, who report bugs and improvements, in a working situation. Their comments are used to correct and refine the software.

**Syntax and logic errors**
Whenever a program is being created it is likely that there will be errors in the code.
There are two types of errors – syntax and logic errors.

**A syntax error** is a grammatical mistake in the code. For example, it could be caused by a misspelling, e.g.‘prnit’ instead of ‘print’ or by missing colons, semi-colons or brackets.
The best way to spot and prevent syntax errors is by the use of an IDE – Integrated Development Environment.

**A logic error** is a fault in the logic of the program and cause unintended output.
For example an ‘AND’ operator might have been used instead of an ‘OR’ operator or in the examples in lesson 1, the Boolean variables might have been set to ‘True’ instead or ‘False’.
Again, IDEs help to spot logic errors by setting breakpoints or variable tracing
