In this lesson we will look at how programmers should test their programs.

### The purpose of testing

- It is technically correct, it does not contain any bugs, and it produces the expected results.
- It meets the needs of the user. It might function perfectly, but does it actually do what the user needed? Is it easy to use? Can data be input and output in a convenient way?

The first of these can be tested completely by the programmer and is called **alpha testing**
